<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## Background the Project
<p align="justify">
Waste management in Indonesia faces serious challenges due to low recycling rates and inefficient waste supply chains. Based on data from the Ministry of Environment and Forestry (KLHK) in 2022, Indonesia produces 68.5 million tons of waste per year, but only 9% is recycled. The lack of price transparency, inaccurate waste classification, and poor coordination between users, intermediaries, and industries have resulted in low economic value of waste.</p>

<p align="justify">
The waste crisis in Indonesia is exacerbated by the lack of recycling facilities and public awareness. From the 33.6 million tons of annual waste in Indonesia, only 60.9% is well-managed, while recycling rates remain low. Through discussions with recycling industry players, we identified main problems: lack of price transparency and classification errors in recognizing waste types, which cause inefficiencies in the supply chain.</p>

<p align="justify">
To bridge this gap, we developed "GreenSort," a technology-based B2B platform to improve waste transaction efficiency and support the circular economy. GreenSort is a web-based platform that helps reduce waste problems in Indonesia by making it easier for individuals and companies to sell their waste to waste managers with prices calculated automatically based on waste type and weight, using image recognition technology.</p>

<p align="justify">
Using the RealWaste dataset, GreenSort can recognize nine types of waste, such as cardboard, food scraps, glass, metal, paper, plastic, textiles, other waste, and vegetation. The platform also provides simple suggestions on how to manage waste in a more environmentally friendly way. Through an auction system that connects waste to the recycling industry, GreenSort serves as a real solution to support a cleaner environment and local economy. We hope this platform can support KLHK's target to reduce 30% of waste by 2030 and promote sustainable waste management in Indonesia.
